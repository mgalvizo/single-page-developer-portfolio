## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   Any field is empty
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
-   **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
-   **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

### What I learned

Writing React functional components, hooks and props with TypeScript.

Writing a POST request to persist form data into a database.

Writing a query that performs a mutation adding a new entry to the database.

Showing a success or error notification when performing the query.
